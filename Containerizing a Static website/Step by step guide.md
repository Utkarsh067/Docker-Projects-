# Steps
1. Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) from the given link.

2. Create a Docker project folder on your PC

      In that folder, first create a Docker file and write this code
   
```
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
RUN apt-get install -y nginx

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

3. After this open the terminal and copy the docker project folder's path in it using "cd path"

4. Now, to create an image use the code 
      ``` docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/my-web-app:latest . ```
It will create your image on Docker Hub

5. To check if the image has been created or not, you can run ```docker images```
      It will print all of the images in docker hub.

6. now run ```docker run -p 8080:80 --name <container-name> <image-name>``` and open browser and write "localhost:8080" and press enter

It will show this because we haven't uploaded any html file on it

7. In the same folder create another folder named  'html', and write your html code in it and save it.

8. Now, go back to dockerfile and update it
```
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
RUN apt-get install -y nginx

COPY <html-folder-name> /var/www/html

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

9. Now again build the image ```docker run -p 8080:80 --name <container-name> <image-name>``` and run it using 
 
   ```docker run -p 8080:80 --name <container-name> <image-name```

10. Refresh your tab, and you can see your website there
