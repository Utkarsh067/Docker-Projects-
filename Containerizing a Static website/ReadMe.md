# About the Project

In this project, we created a docker image, a container. We stored/containerized our HTML file in a container using Docker Hub, Ubuntu, and Nginx.

## But why we containerized it?
We containerized our web app to leverage the benefits of portability, efficiency, and agility, ensuring consistent deployment across various environments, faster delivery, improved security, and easier management, ultimately enhancing the user experience and operational efficiency.
