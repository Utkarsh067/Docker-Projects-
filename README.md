# Docker-Projects

## What is Docker?
Docker is an open source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

**In this Repository, we will be integrating/deploying our projects in Docker Hub.**

### Why we need Docer?
Docker allows you to ship, test, and deploy your applications in any environment without worrying about incompatible issues regardless of the machine's configuration settings. Thus, no less work when developing applications coupled with a standardized way to deploy them.
